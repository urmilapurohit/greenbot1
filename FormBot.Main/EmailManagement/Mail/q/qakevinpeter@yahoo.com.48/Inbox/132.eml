Software Performance Testing ensures success of a Software Application Mar =
1, 2016 
  
   
  
 Just a single crash of your software application can prompt your users to =
move on to your competitors! Do you really want that?? 
  
 In today's fast-paced digital world, performance is a make-or-break qualit=
y for software. It matters more than the features and look-n-feel of a soft=
ware application. Speed, Capacity, Scalability and Stability are key factor=
s that determines the success of a software application. So, to ensure that=
 the software works well and error-free, Software Performance Testing comes=
 into picture, which is a means of Quality Assurance (QA). 
  
 Software Performance Testing process involves testing of various software =
applications to ensure that they will perform well under expected performan=
ce criteria like Users Load, Data Load, Response Time, Hits per second etc.=
 The objective of such type of performance testing is to eliminate software=
 performance bottlenecks. 
  
 What needs to be checked in Software Performance Testing?  
  
 a. Stress testing: The objective is to identify breaking point of an appli=
cation. What happens when the system is pushed beyond the limits, does it b=
reak the recoverability of the system? 
  
 b. Load testing: The objective is to check loads that your systems are sup=
posed to handle on different times and events to help you plan your investm=
ents and architecture accordingly. 
  
 c. Volume testing: The objective is to assess your volume needs to help yo=
u plan your capacity. Under Volume testing large number of Data is populate=
d in database and the overall software system's behavior is monitored. 
  
 d. Endurance testing: What about sustained load for long periods of time? =
The objective is to make sure the application can handle the expected load =
over a long period of time. 
  
 What are the important Performance parameters monitored? 
  
 Some of the main parameters that are monitored while software performance =
testing are: 
  
 Response time: it means the time from when a user enters a request until t=
he first character of the response is received. 
 Memory use: amount of physical memory available to processes on a computer=
. 
 Thread counts: application's health can be measured by the number of threa=
ds that are running and currently active. 
 Throughput: rate a computer or network receives requests per second. 
 Bandwidth: shows the bits per second used by a network interface. 
 Maximum active sessions: the maximum number of sessions that can be active=
 at once. 
 Hits per second: the number of hits on a web server during each second of =
a load test. 
 Error rates: percentage rates of requests with errors. 
 Connection pooling: number of user requests that are met by pooled connect=
ions. The more requests met by connections in the pool, the better the perf=
ormance will be. 
 How to do Software Performance Testing? 
  
 Nowadays wide variety of software performance testing tools are available =
in the market. Some of the most popular tools are mentioned below: 
  
 HP LoadRunner: It is the most popular software performance testing tool in=
 the market today. This tool is capable of simulating hundreds and thousand=
s of users, setting applications under real-life loads to determine their b=
ehavior under expected loads. LoadRunner features a virtual user generator =
which simulates the actions of live human users. It supports various protoc=
ols like web, Windows, SAP, Flex, Silverlight etc. It=E2=80=99s a commercia=
l tool and costly as well! 
  
 Apache JMeter: It is well-known software performance testing tool in IT wo=
rld. Although its techie friendly but it does not support many protocols. I=
t does not possess great GUI features like other commercial tools but it gi=
ves correct and trustworthy results if used precisely. JMeter is mainly use=
d for web and web service applications. It can be explored with many other =
tools like Blazmeter, SOAP UI, New Relic and YSlow for better extension, an=
alysis and reporting. One of the best thing about JMeter is that it is an o=
pen source, i.e. Free tool! 
  
 Selection of tools depends on many factors such as types of protocol suppo=
rted, hardware requirements, platform support, license cost, ROI, etc. A ri=
ght software testing & quality assurance company can help you selecting the=
 right tool based on requirements and also conducting the software testing =
effectively and efficiently. 
  
 Conclusion 
  
 You love your customers unconditionally, but they will love you back only =
if you offer a software product that performs better in extreme conditions.=
 It is absolutely critical to have a well-performing software application t=
hat lets the end user carry out given tasks without undue perceived delay o=
r irritation. Software Performance Testing process ensures improved custome=
r satisfaction, loyalty, and retention.

 Thread counts: application's health can be measured by the number of threa=

 Throughput: rate a computer or network receives requests per second. 
 Bandwidth: shows the bits per second used by a network interface. 
 Maximum active sessions: the maximum number of sessions that can be active=

 Hits per second: the number of hits on a web server during each second of =
a load test. 
 Error rates: percentage rates of requests with errors. 
 Connection pooling: number of user requests that are met by pooled connect=

in the market. Some of the most popular tools are mentioned below: 
  
 HP LoadRunner: It is the most popular software performance testing tool in=
 the market today. This tool is capable of simulating hundreds and thousand=
s of users, setting applications under real-life loads to determine their b=
ehavior under expected loads. LoadRunner features a virtual user generator =
which simulates the actions of live human users. It supports various protoc=
ols like web, Windows, SAP, Flex, Silverlight etc. It=E2=80=99s a commercia=
l tool and costly as well! 
  
 Apache JMeter: It is well-known software performance testing tool in IT wo=
rld. Although its techie friendly but it does not support many protocols. I=
t does not possess great GUI features like other commercial tools but it gi=
ves correct and trustworthy results if used precisely. JMeter is mainly use=
d for web and web service applications. It can be explored with many other =
tools like Blazmeter, SOAP UI, New Relic and YSlow for better extension, an=
alysis and reporting. One of the best thing about JMeter is that it is an o=
pen source, i.e. Free tool! 
  
 Selection of tools depends on many factors such as types of protocol suppo=
