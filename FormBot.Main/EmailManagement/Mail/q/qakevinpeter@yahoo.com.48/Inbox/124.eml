Software Performance Testing ensures success of a Software ApplicationMar
1, 2016

Just a single crash of your software application can prompt your users to
move on to your competitors! Do you really want that??

In today's fast-paced digital world, performance is a make-or-break quality
for software. It matters more than the features and look-n-feel of a
software application. Speed, Capacity, Scalability and Stability are key
factors that determines the success of a software application. So, to
ensure that the software works well and error-free, Software Performance
Testing comes into picture, which is a means of Quality Assurance (QA).

[image: software performance testing]
<http://www.tatvasoft.com/software-development-services/testing-qa>

Software Performance Testing process involves testing of various software
applications to ensure that they will perform well under expected
performance criteria like Users Load, Data Load, Response Time, Hits per
second etc. The objective of such type of performance testing is to
eliminate software performance bottlenecks
<http://www.testingperformance.org/performance-articles/artificial-bottlene=
ck>
.
What needs to be checked in Software Performance Testing?

[image: performance testing process]a. Stress testing: The objective is to
identify breaking point of an application. What happens when the system is
pushed beyond the limits, does it break the recoverability of the system?

b. Load testing: The objective is to check loads that your systems are
supposed to handle on different times and events to help you plan your
investments and architecture accordingly.

c. Volume testing: The objective is to assess your volume needs to help you
plan your capacity. Under Volume testing large number of Data is populated
in database and the overall software system's behavior is monitored.

d. Endurance testing: What about sustained load for long periods of time?
The objective is to make sure the application can handle the expected load
over a long period of time.
What are the important Performance parameters monitored?

Some of the main parameters that are monitored while software performance
testing are:

   - Response time: it means the time from when a user enters a request
   until the first character of the response is received.
   - Memory use: amount of physical memory available to processes on a
   computer.
   - Thread counts: application's health can be measured by the number of
   threads that are running and currently active.
   - Throughput: rate a computer or network receives requests per second.
   - Bandwidth: shows the bits per second used by a network interface.
   - Maximum active sessions: the maximum number of sessions that can be
   active at once.
   - Hits per second: the number of hits on a web server during each second
   of a load test.
   - Error rates: percentage rates of requests with errors.
   - Connection pooling: number of user requests that are met by pooled
   connections. The more requests met by connections in the pool, the bette=
r
   the performance will be.

How to do Software Performance Testing?

Nowadays wide variety of software performance testing tools
<http://performance-testing.org/content/performance-testing-tools> are
available in the market. Some of the most popular tools are mentioned below=
:

HP LoadRunner: It is the most popular software performance testing tool in
the market today. This tool is capable of simulating hundreds and thousands
of users, setting applications under real-life loads to determine their
behavior under expected loads. LoadRunner features a virtual user generator
which simulates the actions of live human users. It supports various
protocols like web, Windows, SAP, Flex, Silverlight etc. It=E2=80=99s a com=
mercial
tool and costly as well!

Apache JMeter: It is well-known software performance testing tool in IT
world. Although its techie friendly but it does not support many protocols.
It does not possess great GUI features like other commercial tools but it
gives correct and trustworthy results if used precisely. JMeter
<http://jmeter.apache.org/index.html> is mainly used for web and web
service applications. It can be explored with many other tools like
Blazmeter, SOAP UI, New Relic and YSlow for better extension, analysis and
reporting. One of the best thing about JMeter is that it is an open source,
i.e. Free tool!

Selection of tools depends on many factors such as types of protocol
supported, hardware requirements, platform support, license cost, ROI, etc.
A right software testing & quality assurance company
<http://www.tatvasoft.com/software-development-services/testing-qa> can
help you selecting the right tool based on requirements and also conducting
the software testing effectively and efficiently.
Conclusion

You love your customers unconditionally, but they will love you back only
if you offer a software product that performs better in extreme conditions.
It is absolutely critical to have a well-performing software application
that lets the end user carry out given tasks without undue perceived delay
or irritation. Software Performance Testing process ensures improved
customer satisfaction, loyalty, and retention.

What needs to be checked in Software Performance Testing?

[image: performance testing process]a. Stress testing: The objective is to
identify breaking point of an application. What happens when the system is
pushed beyond the limits, does it break the recoverability of the system?

b. Load testing: The objective is to check loads that your systems are
supposed to handle on different times and events to help you plan your
investments and architecture accordingly.

c. Volume testing: The objective is to assess your volume needs to help you
plan your capacity. Under Volume testing large number of Data is populated
in database and the overall software system's behavior is monitored.

d. Endurance testing: What about sustained load for long periods of time?
The objective is to make sure the application can handle the expected load
over a long period of time.
What are the important Performance parameters monitored?

Some of the main parameters that are monitored while software performance
testing are:

   - Response time: it means the time from when a user enters a request
   until the first character of the response is received.
   - Memory use: amount of physical memory available to processes on a
   computer.
   - Thread counts: application's health can be measured by the number of
   threads that are running and currently active.
   - Throughput: rate a computer or network receives requests per second.
   - Bandwidth: shows the bits per second used by a network interface.
   - Maximum active sessions: the maximum number of sessions that can be
   active at once.
   - Hits per second: the number of hits on a web server during each second
   of a load test.
   - Error rates: percentage rates of requests with errors.
   - Connection pooling: number of user requests that are met by pooled
   connections. The more requests met by connections in the pool, the bette=
r
   the performance will be.

How to do Software Performance Testing?

Nowadays wide variety of software performance testing tools
<http://performance-testing.org/content/performance-testing-tools> are
available in the market. Some of the most popular tools are mentioned below=
:

HP LoadRunner: It is the most popular software performance testing tool in
the market today. This tool is capable of simulating hundreds and thousands
of users, setting applications under real-life loads to determine their
behavior under expected loads. LoadRunner features a virtual user generator
which simulates the actions of live human users. It supports various
protocols like web, Windows, SAP, Flex, Silverlight etc. It=E2=80=99s a com=
mercial
tool and costly as well!

Apache JMeter: It is well-known software performance testing tool in IT
world. Although its techie friendly but it does not support many protocols.
It does not possess great GUI features like other commercial tools but it
gives correct and trustworthy results if used precisely. JMeter
<http://jmeter.apache.org/index.html> is mainly used for web and web
service applications. It can be explored with many other tools like
Blazmeter, SOAP UI, New Relic and YSlow for better extension, analysis and
reporting. One of the best thing about JMeter is that it is an open source,
i.e. Free tool!

Selection of tools depends on many factors such as types of protocol
supported, hardware requirements, platform support, license cost, ROI, etc.
A right software testing & quality assurance company
<http://www.tatvasoft.com/software-development-services/testing-qa> can
help you selecting the right tool based on requirements and also conducting
the software testing effectively and efficiently.
Conclusion

You love your customers unconditionally, but they will love you back only
if you offer a software product that performs better in extreme conditions.
It is absolutely critical to have a well-performing software application
that lets the end user carry out given tasks without undue perceived delay
or irritation. Software Performance Testing process ensures improved
customer satisfaction, loyalty, and retention.

Software Performance Testing ensures success of a Software Application

Mar 1, 2016

Just a single crash of your software application can prompt your users to
move on to your competitors! Do you really want that??

In today's fast-paced digital world, performance is a make-or-break quality
for software. It matters more than the features and look-n-feel of a
software application. Speed, Capacity, Scalability and Stability are key
factors that determines the success of a software application. So, to
ensure that the software works well and error-free, Software Performance
Testing comes into picture, which is a means of Quality Assurance (QA).

Software Performance Testing process involves testing of various software
applications to ensure that they will perform well under expected
performance criteria like Users Load, Data Load, Response Time, Hits per
second etc. The objective of such type of performance testing is to
eliminate software performance bottlenecks
