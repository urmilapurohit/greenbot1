cared Off by the Big, Bad Paragraph 
  
 I was reading the list of upcoming business meetings in a weekly email fro=
m The Seattle Times, when a meeting announcement caught my attention. The p=
resenter was going to speak on a topic that interests me--the steps in grow=
ing one's business. I often weigh the advantages of getting bigger vs. stay=
ing small as a business, so I thought I would register for her talk. 
  
 But I wanted to know more about the presenter, so I clicked the link to he=
r blog. That's when things went wrong. 
  
 Her latest blog entry was one huge paragraph 41 lines long. Can you imagin=
e her 325 words in one big block? You don't have to--I have created a 325-w=
ord block of text below. Don't bother to read the words. They're just the t=
ext you are already reading. 
  
 Don't read this sample big, bad paragraph--just notice it.
