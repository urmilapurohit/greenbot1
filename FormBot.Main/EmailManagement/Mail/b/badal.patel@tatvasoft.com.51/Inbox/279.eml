Hi Badal,

I understand, but a change is always worrisome.=20

One major reason I work with a large company like Tatvasoft is that I =
trust you to solve these transfers.

It is critical that we have a manual for programmers about Golfpyramid, =
its purpose, how its build etc, and good comments in the code, so that =
new programmers can learn faster.

Cheers,
John
